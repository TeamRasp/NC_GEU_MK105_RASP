This is the Data Acquisiton Repository of Philomath, Team RASP.

We're scraping data from various job websites and news websites- namely Indeed, Monster and Twitter
For our news data we're also using RSS bots to collect information various news sites like the Times Of India and The Hindu
We also have an OCR bot in place, to get data from scanned PDFs. With this, we're easily able to decipher images and turn them into text.
With all this mountain of data, it's difficult to manually navigate around so we have also built a summarizer bot that shortens the collected text and withholds the relavant data.
